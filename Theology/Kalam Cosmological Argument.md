The most prominent form of the argument, as defended by William Lane Craig, states the Kalam cosmological argument as the following [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism")

P1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause.
P2) The [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") began to exist.
P3) Therefore, the universe has a cause.
## The Kalam Debunked

1. All it would prove is there is a cause of the universe, it's not even related to theology
2. While it would prove the universe had a cause, it wouldn’t prove that this cause itself was without a cause (it wouldn't prove that a first cause existed)
### Logical Flaws

* **Equivocation fallacy** - switches between two different definitions of the universe
	P2) "scientific definition of the universe" - all matter space and time
	P3) "colloquial definition" - everything that exists, has existed and will exist

When we say that the universe began to exist using the scientific definition, we're saying all matter time and space began to exist in the same capacity it does now.

We are not saying absolutely everything came into being from absolutely nothing - this is the problem with the equivocation fallacy

It asserts that something can come from nothing - creatio ex nihilo (never been demonstrated to occur)

Special pleading - the cause of the universe didn’t begin to exist and therefore it didn’t have a cause (without justification)
