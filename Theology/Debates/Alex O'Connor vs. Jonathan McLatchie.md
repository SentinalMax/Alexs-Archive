# McLatchie Opening Statements
## Evidence For Theism
- The Universe had a beginning
- The fine-tuning of the laws of physics
- The evidence of biological design
- The evidence for the truth of Christianity

**Note:** Erroneously compares DNA information to computer data information. McLatchie makes the claim that because we witness the creation of new information (in a digital medium) by an intelligence this must mean that DNA was created by an intelligence. This is a derivation of [[Quick Debate Dictionary#^ab9749|Paley’s Watchmaker Analogy]].

*"Paley argued that **just as a watch is a complex and intricate mechanism that implies the existence of a watchmaker**, the natural world is also a complex and intricate mechanism that implies the existence of a divine creator."* - [Study Mind](https://studymind.co.uk/questions/what-is-paley-s-watch-analogy/#:~:text=Paley%20argued%20that%20just%20as,existence%20of%20a%20divine%20creator.)

### Finely Tuned Genetic Code

Here McLatchie claims "...The structure of the genetic code is set up to mitigate the effects of errors that might be incorporated during translation." But the complexity and error-correcting nature of these systems can be attributed to the evolutionary process under naturalism, the pre-supposition of theism or a deity to explain this is not necessary.

### Evolving a Genetic Code

Here McLatchie presents the idea that mutation changes would be detrimental & would not allow for the evolution of genetic code. But he does not posit an alternative hypothesis instead he just criticizes this point and moves on.

### [[Quick Debate Dictionary#^d63aab|Irreducible Complexity]]
^ada787

**Michael Behe's Definition:** "By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."

Behe makes a comparison to a mousetrap, which if you remove a part of the mousetrap it cannot function as a mousetrap.

**The problem:** Behe assumes that function is intrinsic to the object, but it is not. Objects can have multiple different functions. If you remove one or two pieces of a mousetrap it may no longer function as a mousetrap but it could function as other things like a tie clip or paper clip, etc... The point here is not that it'd be a good tie clip by the way. The main point is that none of this proves something that's "irreducibly complex" couldn't have come together from a small series of steps. It would've had to just have a different function before it came to have its current properties. 

Take for example the human eye. Eyes began to exist as really simplistic photo receptors [[link to eye evolution here]] which could differentiate between light and dark, this was a useful adaptation because it allowed organisms to adjust various functions in accordance with the time of day, including hunting, feeding, breeding, etc... Over time, the eye became more complex, endowing organisms with the potential to perceive their surrounding environment to a higher degree of accuracy.

This serious flaw in Behe's argument was brought to light by the [Kitzmiller v. Dover case](https://ncse.ngo/remembering-kitzmiller-v-dover#:~:text=In%202005%2C%20parents%2C%20teachers%2C,schools%20violates%20the%20U.S.%20Constitution.).
* *"In 2005, parents, teachers, and scientists from around the country came together in **Kitzmiller v. Dover** to defend the integrity of the public science classroom. The result: a decision that teaching "intelligent design" in public schools violates the U.S. Constitution."*

This notion has been debunked so many times.

## Evidence Against Theism

### [Problem Of Devine Hiddenness](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/#:~:text=So%2C%20the%20core%20of%20Schellenberg's,that%20God%20does%20not%20exist.)

*“A nonbelief phenomenon could include patterns of nonbelief, such as the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">geographic or temporal distribution of nonbelief</mark>, as well as different **kinds** of nonbelief, such as “nonresistant” or “reasonable” nonbelief.”* – [Passage](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-hiddenness-argument-against-gods-existence/#:~:text=A%20nonbelief%20phenomenon%20could%20include%20patterns%20of%20nonbelief%2C%20such%20as%20the%20geographic%20or%20temporal%20distribution%20of%20nonbelief%2C%20as%20well%20as%20different%20kinds%20of%20nonbelief%2C%20such%20as%20%E2%80%9Cnonresistant%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Creasonable%E2%80%9D%20nonbelief.)

O’Connor outlines that some people, even who seek or try to find god (and are fully submissive to the idea and willing to do so) still do not *find* him. 

“If theism is to offer a sufficient account of reality then it must offer an account of what J.L. Schellenberg has famously labeled non-resistant non-belief, which he distinguished from resistant non-belief.”

* ***Resistant non-belief** - Those who purposely choose not to believe, for a myriad of reasons; stubbornness for example.

* **Non-resistant non-belief** - People who’d like & are willing to believe in a god but have been presented no opportunity to do so. Those who have *knocked on the door* and received no answer. ^b1f408
#### O’Connor’s *DH* Syllogism

P1) If there is a god he is perfectly loving
P2) If a perfectly loving god exists non-resistant non-belief does not occur
P3) Non-resistant non-belief does occur
P4) No perfectly loving god exists
C) There is no god
##### Breakdown:

P1) Appeals to God’s omni-benevolence property.
P2) A perfectly loving god (one that wants a relationship with everyone) would not permit non-resistant non-belief.
P3) Experiential evidence suggests people exist that have sought out God and not found him & continue to remain absent of his presence.
P4) Because a perfectly loving God would seek a relationship with those who want it, a perfectly loving God does not exist
C) Follows from premises there is no God. 

The argument here that O’Connor provides is that atheism provides a better explanation of [[Alex O'Connor vs. Jonathan McLatchie#^b1f408|non-resistant non-belief]] than theism. Operating under the presupposition that a god does not exist explains perfectly well why people who’ve devoted themselves to the concept of a god still do not find him.
