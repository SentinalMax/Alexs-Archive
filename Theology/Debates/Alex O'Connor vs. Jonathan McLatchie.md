# McLatchie Opening Statements
## Evidence for Theism
- The Universe had a beginning
- The fine-tuning of the laws of physics
- The evidence of biological design
- The evidence for the truth of Christianity

**Note:** Erroneously compares DNA information to computer data information. McLatchie makes the claim that because we witness the creation of new information (in a digital medium) by an intelligence this must mean that DNA was created by an intelligence. This is a derivation of [[Paley's Watchmaker Analogy.]]

*"Paley argued that **just as a watch is a complex and intricate mechanism that implies the existence of a watchmaker**, the natural world is also a complex and intricate mechanism that implies the existence of a divine creator."* - [Study Mind](https://studymind.co.uk/questions/what-is-paley-s-watch-analogy/#:~:text=Paley%20argued%20that%20just%20as,existence%20of%20a%20divine%20creator.)

### Finely Tuned Genetic Code

Here McLatchie claims "...The structure of the genetic code is set up to mitigate the effects of errors that might be incorporated during translation." But the complexity and error-correcting nature of these systems can be attributed to the evolutionary process under naturalism, the pre-supposition of theism or a deity to explain this is not necessary.

### Evolving a Genetic Code

Here McLatchie presents the idea that mutation changes would be detrimental & would not allow for the evolution of genetic code. But he does not posit an alternative hypothesis instead he just criticizes this point just and moves on.

### [[Irreducible Complexity]]

**Michael Behe's Definition:** "By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."

Behe makes a comparison to a mousetrap, which if you remove a part of the mousetrap it cannot function as a mousetrap. 

**The problem:** Behe assumes that function is intrinsic to the object, but it is not. Objects can have multiple different functions. If you remove one or two pieces of a mousetrap it may no longer function as a mousetrap but it could function as other things like a tie clip or paper clip, etc... The point here is not that it'd be a good tie clip by the way. The main point is that none of this proves something that's "irreducibly complex" couldn't have come together from a small series of steps. It would've had to just have a different function before it came to have its current properties. 

Take for example the human eye, eyes began to exist as really simplistic photo receptors [[link to eye evolution here]] which could detect light and dark, this was a useful adaptation because it allowed organisms to adjust various functions in accordance with the time of day, including hunting, feeding, breeding, etc... Over time, the eye became more complex, endowing organisms with the potential to perceive their surrounding environment to a higher degree of accuracy.

This notion has been debunked so many times.
