## The Conversation

**Someone:** The final cause of evolution is to sustain the existence of the organism and its progeny, the ultimate end is not only to create life but to secure its existence. That is its purpose.

**Me:** There is no end to sustaining existence what are you on about?

**Someone:** End = objective.

**Me:** Again this is projecting your own teleology onto life, evolution does not have a 'goal' it's a physical process as a result of physical laws.

**Someone:** The goal is to adapt.

**Me:** No this is your own prescription, organisms happen to adapt as a result of physical processes.

**Someone:** And what does that adaptation result in? Yeah, they are better fit to survive in their environment.

**Me:** Considering 99% of all species have gone extinct this is not really a process with the goal of preserving life, your prescription is erroneous there is no telos behind evolution, life has no stance independent purpose it's just chemistry conforming to physical processes.

**Someone:** Adaptation is a natural part of the evolutionary process, just as species die out new species arise, just because extinction happens doesn’t mean that during a species' existence, its objective wasn’t to sustain its existence as well as its progeny, its failure to maintain the existence of its own descendants isn’t proof that there was no goal to do so.

## The Response

In this conversation, it's clear that I’m emphasizing that evolution does not have an intrinsic goal or purpose, which is a fundamental concept in understanding evolutionary biology. When discussing evolution, it's important to distinguish between the apparent "goals" of natural processes and actual intentional goals, which require conscious intent.

My argument centers on the idea that adaptation and survival are outcomes of natural processes, governed by the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than purposes endowed by these processes. Evolution through natural selection is about differential survival and reproduction, but this doesn't imply a directed goal; rather, it's a consequence of certain traits providing a reproductive advantage in a given environment.

**Someone** seems to be attributing a teleological perspective to evolution, suggesting that species have an inherent objective to sustain their existence and that of their progeny. This view anthropomorphizes natural processes by ascribing to them intentions and goals, akin to human objectives.

“Your perspective on evolution as having a 'goal' to sustain existence and progeny is an anthropomorphic interpretation. In evolutionary biology, what seems like a 'goal' of adaptation is actually an outcome of various unguided, natural processes. These processes do not operate with foresight or intention; they simply occur. Species do not adapt with an objective to survive or flourish; they simply do, or do not, based on the traits that arise randomly and their suitability to current environmental conditions. The fact that 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct underscores this. It's not about a failure to meet a goal, but rather an illustration that adaptation and survival are not directed processes but contingent on numerous factors, often beyond the control or prediction of the evolving species themselves. This is why projecting an 'objective' onto these processes misrepresents how evolution actually works."
