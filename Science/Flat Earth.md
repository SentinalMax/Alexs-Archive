## Origins

**[Eratosthenes knew the earth was round in 240 BC](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200606/history.cfm#:~:text=240%20B.C.%20Eratosthenes%20Measures%20the%20Earth&text=By%20around%20500%20B.C.%2C%20most,method%20of%20estimating%20its%20circumference.)**
 
 *”By around 500 B.C., <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">most ancient Greeks believed that Earth was round, not flat</mark>. But they had no idea how big the planet is until about 240 B.C., when Eratosthenes devised a clever method of estimating its circumference.”*

*”Possibly the first to propose a spherical Earth based on actual physical evidence was Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), who listed several arguments for a spherical Earth: 

* Ships disappear hull first when they sail over the horizon 
* Earth casts a round shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse 
* Different constellations are visible at different latitudes

*”Around this time Greek philosophers had begun to believe the world could be explained by natural processes rather than invoking the gods.”* ([[God of The Gaps]])

Eratosthenes learned that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun illuminated the bottom of a well in Syene without casting any shadows, indicating the sun was directly overhead. He measured the angle of a shadow cast by a stick in Alexandria at the same time, finding it to be about 7.2 degrees, or 1/50 of a circle. Using the distance between Alexandria and Syene, calculated by bematists to be about 5000 stadia, Eratosthenes estimated the Earth's circumference to be about 250,000 stadia. Modern scholars estimate the length of Eratosthenes' stadium to be between 500 and 600 feet, putting his calculation between 24,000 and 29,000 miles. The actual circumference of the Earth is about 24,900 miles. 

* This measurement was calculated 2,264 years ago from 2024.
* With around 96.39% degree of accuracy for the lowest estimate.
