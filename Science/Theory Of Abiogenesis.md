## What is abiogenesis?

**Abiogenesis**, the idea that [life](https://www.britannica.com/science/life) arose from nonlife more than 3.5 billion years ago on [Earth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth).

Essentially, abiogenesis is the idea that the first life forms on earth (insert LUCA) came about as a result of really mundane and simplistic conditions. Then gradually became increasingly more complex.

**Biogenesis**, is the idea that life comes from other forms of life. And generally is noted as preceding abiogenesis.

*Note:* When creationists, or abiogenesis deniers claim “why isn’t new life created?” → This is mainly due to the fact that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Earth’s current atmospheric composition has made the formation of new life impossible.  </mark>

- [ ] #task Research why it's the case that the current atmospheric conditions do not allow new life to be created through abiogenesis.
