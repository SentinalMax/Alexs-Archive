### Access to scientific literature:
#### Sci-Hub

*“Sci-Hub is the most controversial project in modern science. The goal of Sci-Hub is to provide free and unrestricted access to all scientific knowledge.”*

1. [Sci-Hub SE](https://sci-hub.st/)
2. [Sci-Hub ST](https://sci-hub.st/)
3. [Sci-Hub RU](https://sci-hub.ru/)

Sci-Hub gets taken down quite frequently because *it may be slightly illegal.* This means you’ll have to search for one of the many mirrors of Sci-Hub. 

You can find those [here](https://scihub.help/)
