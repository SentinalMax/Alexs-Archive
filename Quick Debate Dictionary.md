* **Tautology** - The saying of the same thing twice in different words

* **Parsimony** - The parsimony principle is basic to all science and tells us to choose the simplest scientific explanation that fits the evidence.
	* **Example:** Fewer premises = Lower likelihood of error

* **Moralizing** - The action of commenting on issues of right and wrong, typically with an unfounded air of superiority

* **Fallibility** - The tendency to make mistakes or to be wrong

* **Elucidate** - Make something clear/explain

* **Straw man** - An intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent’s real argument

* **Ad hominem** - A personal attack directed at someone rather than a position they hold

* **Confirmation Bias** - The tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one’s existing beliefs or theories

* **Non-inferential** - No inference, a baseless claim

* **Non-sequitur** - A conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument

* **Volition** - By one’s own will

* **Axiom** - An indemonstrable first principle, rule, or maxim, that is generally accepted.
	* **Maxim** - A general truth, fundamental principle, or rule of conduct

* **Freudian slip** - An unintentional error regarded as revealing subconscious feelings

* **Veracity** - Conformity to facts; accuracy

* **Gish gallop** - A rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm their opponent by providing an excessive number of arguments with no regard for the accuracy or strength of those arguments

* **Infinite regress** - An infinite series of entities governed by a recursive principle that determines how each entity in the series depends on or is produced by its predecessor. (Example: The idea that God doesn’t have a creator would lock one into an infinite regression)

### Philosophy:

* **Ontology** - Study of the nature of being (metaphysics)

* **Teleology** - Study of purpose, an explanation of something in terms of the purpose they serve. (Means to the end)

* **Epistemology** - Theory of knowledge

* **Metaphysics** - The branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time and space

* **Syllogism** - A kind of logical argument that utilizes deductive reasoning along with two premises and a conclusion

* **Fallibilist** - The epistemological thesis that no belief (theory, view, thesis, and so on) can ever be rationally supported or justified in a conclusive way. Always, there remains a possible doubt as to the truth of the belief

* **Nominative Determinism** - The theory that people are psychologically predisposed to pursue occupations or interests that resemble or evoke their names in some way

* **Solipsism** - The idea that only one’s own mind is sure to exist; frowned upon (who created the mind?)

* **Empiricism** - The idea that all knowledge is derived from sense experience (observational evidence)

* **Composition/Division Fallacy** - The fallacy of composition consists in treating a distributed characteristic as if it were collective. It occurs when one makes the mistake of attributing to a group (or a whole) some characteristic that is true only of its individual members (or its parts), and then makes inferences based on that mistake

* **Sunk-cost Fallacy** - The phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have invested heavily in it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be more beneficial

* **Ad populum Fallacy** - A [fallacious argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy "Fallacy") which is based on claiming a truth or affirming something is good because many people think so

* [**Equivocation Fallacy**](https://www.txst.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Equivocation.html) - Occurs when a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument. ^8cc9a8
	* Example: “I have the right to watch "The Real World."  Therefore it's right for me to watch the show.  So, I think I'll watch this "Real World" marathon tonight instead of studying for my exam.”

* **Occam's razor** - If you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one. (Appeal to parsimony)

* **Epistemic solipsism** - The claim that one can only be sure of the existence of one's mind. The existence of other minds and the external world is not necessarily rejected but one cannot be sure of its existence

* **Dualism** - The division of something conceptually into two opposed or contrasted aspects, or the state of being so divided

* **Social Contract Theory** - [Nearly as old as philosophy itself](https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/), is the view that persons’ moral and/or political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live

* [**Paley’s Watchmaker Analogy**](https://studymind.co.uk/questions/what-is-paley-s-watch-analogy/#:~:text=Paley%20argued%20that%20just%20as,existence%20of%20a%20divine%20creator.) - *“Paley argued that **just as a watch is a complex and intricate mechanism that implies the existence of a watchmaker**, the natural world is also a complex and intricate mechanism that implies the existence of a divine creator.”* ^ab9749

* [**Pascal’s Wager**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) - *”Pascal's Wager argues that it is more rational to believe in God than not, because if God exists, the believer gains eternal happiness, while the non-believer risks eternal damnation. Conversely, if God does not exist, the believer loses nothing significant, making belief the safer and more beneficial bet.”*

* Reality - All things within the current state of affairs
* Existence - having properties.
### Logic:

1. **The Law of Identity** - Anything that has been determined to be true, must be identical to itself and different from other things.

2. **The Law of Non-Contradiction** - If something is true it cannot NOT be true at the same time. In other words, a truth cannot be false.

3. **The Law of Excluded Middle** - Defined as there being no “middle man” in-between a truth or falsity; one is either correct or it’s not.

* **Inductive reasoning** - A logical process in which multiple premises, all believed true or found true most of the time, are combined to obtain a specific conclusion

* **Deductive reasoning** - A logical process in which a conclusion is based on the concordance of multiple premises that are generally assumed to be true

## Science

### Biology:

* **Gene duplication and genetic drift** - Two well-known mechanisms which both ADD genetic information

* **Corporeal** - Relating to a person's body, especially as opposed to their spirit

* **Qualia** - The internal and subjective component of sense perceptions, arising from stimulation of the senses by phenomena
